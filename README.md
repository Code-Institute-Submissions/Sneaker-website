# SneakGateWay Shop #

### Interactive Front-end web Development Project 1 ###
By: Melville Ng

## Demo ##
Website site link can be found [here](https://melvilleng.github.io/Sneaker-website/)

## Aim ##
The aim of this project is to build a static E-commerce website for selling of sneaker product
and streetwear item. I have always been collecting sneaker and streetwear product. At the same time, I am reselling sneaker and streetwear item too. The target audience are people like me
who like to keep sneaker and streetwear product for their own collection. Furthermore, creating this
website can help me to reach out to more people and gain more reputation in the sneaker community.

## UX ##
The intention to make the website modern looking, easy to navigate and comfortable on the eyes.
Colours of white and grey are chosen to suit the different colourway of the product. 
The button of blue is to make it stand out. The darker grey at the footer is to show the contrast.

## UI ##
Bootstrap breakpoints is responsive for small, medium and large screens for the navigation bar. When the screen, reaches medium or small screen the navigation bar will change to be a hamburger icon on the top right corner of the website. Drop down menu will appear when u press the hamburger icon which will link you to different pages of the website.
On large screen device the navigation bar will display all the link at the top.

The search button for now is a dummy button search as it will be implemented in the future.
The shop logo at the top left-hand corner can be click and it will bring u back to the homepage.

The alert bar is to notify the customer what shoes are available for pre-order. The click here link will link them to the contact us page so that they can fill up their name, email, phone number and write in the text box the size and shoe they want to pre-order and we will send them a invoice and ask them to place a deposit.

The font of the website was taken from google font to make the font more unique instead of the standard font.


The landing page is to show what type of website site this is. I have placed a banner at the top with the shop name.
The carousel is to show case some of the limited-edition sneakers and street wear items.
The landing page will feature new arrival product of the website. From there they can click on individual view page button to bring them to the product page where they can add to cart the size they want and know the pricing of the product. At the bottom of the page there a subscribe us form for them to fill up their email so that we can send the latest arrival product to notify them. There also a Facebook and Instagram button to link them to the website Facebook and Instagram for them to follow and be notify of the latest new arrival. The footer include link to bring them to the home page or contact us or FAQ page.

For the Yeezy, Nike and Streetwear page it will feature all the product that the website is currently selling they can choose the size they want from the drop-down menu in each product. They can click the add to cart and it will bring them to the cart page.
For now, the add to cart button that link to the cart page is only to show the flow of it. In the future, the add to cart feature will be improve on where they can be added to the cart logo with a drop-down box.
The cart page for now is a dummy page to show case what the cart page will look like. The whole checkout process will be implemented in the future.

## Wireframes ##

be view via this [link](https://github.com/melvilleng/Sneaker-website/tree/master/wireframe).
